# DebugOverlay
A `logcat` alike overlay to display log messages in your app as independent overlay.

Typically in android you would log some app internals for debugging puropose by using `Log.d()`. However, sometimes you may need to display that logging messages right on the screen to make them visible for non developers that have to verify certain app internals, like tracking.

This tiny library adds an overlay as independet `Window` on top of your android application. You can close this `DebugOverlay`-Window by clicking on the close button. The window will then automatically pop up again when the next message to log is detected.

## How to initialize
- Simple initialize:
```java
DebugOverlay.init(context);
```
- Initialize with a custom style:
```java
DebugOverlay.init(context, R.style.CustomDebugOverlay);
```

## How to log a message?
```java
DebugOverlay.log("My logging message");
```

### How to define a style?
There are some properties that you can use to get a custom style
```xml
    <style name="DefaultDebugOverlay">
        <item name="do_backgroundColor">#64000000</item>
        <item name="do_height">100dp</item>
        <item name="do_textColor">#FFF</item>
        <item name="do_textSize">14sp</item>
    </style>
```

## Dependencies
Obviously you wont deliver this `DebugOverlay` with you production code in the play store .apk file. Hence this library provides two maven artifacts to include.
```groovy
debugCompile('com.hannesdorfmann:debugoverlay:0.3.0') // Starts the service and displays the overlay
releaseCompile('com.hannesdorfmann:debugoverlay-noop:0.3.0') // Does nothing
```

The idea is to use gradle build types to add the `DebugOverlay` only to debug builds.
`debugoverlay` is the real implementation and displays the window while `debugoverlay-noop` is a stub and simply does nothing!

## Permissions
Please note that `com.hannesdorfmann:debugoverlay:0.3.0` will add `android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` to your apk. Hence you should avoid to use that dependency for your release `.apk`

## Features
The api is very simple. You can simply log string messages. You can open new issues here on github to make a new feature request. If it is not too complicated and will not add a lot of new methods to the public API (dex count 65k limit) then it's very likely that we can add this feature to this library.
